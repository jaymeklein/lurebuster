# üö® LureBuster - Anti-Phishing Flood | Endpoint Stress Test

Designed to combat phishing by flooding scam sites with deceptive data, LureBuster's configurable traffic engine also serves as a tool for teams to test their own endpoints against high-volume requests.

## üéØ Features  
- **Data Flood**: Generates a huge amount of data
- **Random Data**: Mimics real user data using [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)
- **Parametrized Data**: Dynamically change payloads, using predefined placeholders
  - Example: 'Her first name is **{{PERSON_first_name_female}}**, and her last name is **{{PERSON_last_name_female}}**'
  - Result: 'Her first name is **Michelle**, and her last name is **Gardner**'
  - Internally this will call Faker's [Providers](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html) methods.
- **Multi-Threaded**: Concurrent request engine
- **JSON Templates**: Save/load attack profiles
- **Metrics**: Check realtime requests per second, error rates, attack duration, successful requests

## Can be used for:
### üõ°Ô∏è**Anti-Phishing**:  
  - Generate fake data at scale
  - Mimic organic user data patterns
  - Degrades phishing database utility

### üß™**Endpoint Testing**:  
  - Multi-threaded load simulation  
  - Custom payload injection  
  - Performance metric collection
  - Stress test 

## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance Note
This tool is designed for:
- Authorized security testing (with permission)
- Ethical phishing disruption (targeting confirmed scam sites)
- Legitimate load testing of owned infrastructure
  
‚ö†Ô∏è *Never test systems without explicit authorization.*

## üìê Placeholder Structure
Text placeholders follow [Providers](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html) method structure:
- Wrapped with double curly brackets: `{{...}}`
- Starts with an uppercase provider class: `{{USER_AGENT...}}`
  - eg: [USER_AGENT](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers/faker.providers.user_agent.html)
- Followed by an existing method for that provider:
  - Method without parameters: `{{USER_AGENT_android_platform_token}}`
  - Method with positional parameters: `{{USER_AGENT_chrome(13,63,800,899)}}`
  - Method with keyword parameters: `{{USER_AGENT_chrome(version_from=13,version_to=63,build_from=800,build_to=899)}}`
  - Method with default parameters: `{{USER_AGENT_chrome}}`

## üê≥ Example Endpoint with Docker
#### Creating the Image
```bash
sudo docker build -t example-api-image example-api/.
```

#### Running the Container
```bash
sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 -d --name "lurebuster-example-api" "example-api-image"
```

#### Testing the Endpoints
If everything ran properly, you should see **`Hello, LureBuster!`** at http://localhost:8000, and since I chose [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to host this test endpoint, you can also access swagger [docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) 

#### Checking Endpoint logs
```bash
sudo docker logs -f "lurebuster-example-api"
```
This will open a terminal with all the traffic in the 2 example endpoints.
